# 🎯 INSIDRA

**AI-powered Insider Threat Detection System**

INSIDRA identifies suspicious user behavior by analyzing behavioral drift over time rather than relying on static rules. It learns each user's normal activity patterns and continuously monitors for deviations to catch insider threats before they happen.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection** - Machine learning algorithms that detect unusual behavior patterns
- 📊 **Dynamic Risk Scoring** - Real-time user risk assessment based on behavioral analysis
- 🔍 **Explainable Alerts** - Clear reasoning for why activities are flagged as suspicious
- 📈 **Interactive Dashboard** - Visualize behavioral trends and risk levels
- ⏰ **Continuous Monitoring** - Real-time analysis of login times, file access, and location data
- 🛡️ **Proactive Threat Mitigation** - Take action before security breaches occur

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** - Gathers user behavioral data (login times, file access, location, etc.)
2. **Pattern Learning** - Establishes baseline for each user's normal activity
3. **Anomaly Detection** - Continuously compares current behavior against learned patterns
4. **Risk Scoring** - Assigns dynamic risk scores based on deviation severity
5. **Alert Generation** - Creates explainable alerts with specific reasons for suspicion
